Boost conversions by displaying recent sales notifications for your WooCommerce products. Creates social proof and FOMO!

== Description ==

Simple Falert automatically pulls products from your WooCommerce store and displays attractive "fake" recent sales popups in the corner of your screen (bottom-left or bottom-right).

Show visitors realistic notifications like: "*John Doe from London purchased 2 Simple T-Shirt 5 minutes ago.*"

This plugin helps create a sense of urgency (FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out) and social proof, encouraging visitors to make a purchase by showing that others are actively buying from your store.
